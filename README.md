# Simple Blog Auth React (Scaffold)
Implements:
- Create / edit / delete articles (with validation)
- Private route pattern for authenticated access
- Confirmation modal for delete
- LocalStorage-based mock API (no backend required)

How to run:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open the dev server (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- Authentication is mocked (Login page accepts any username).
- Articles are stored in localStorage.
